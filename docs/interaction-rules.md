# 4️⃣ BEHAVIOR — How does the system respond?

This is where your app feels **alive**, not mechanical.

### User Behavior → System Behavior

| User Action | System Response | Feeling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Drops pin** | Saves quietly | Calm |
| **Records route** | Shows distance live | Alive |
| **Goes offline** | Stores locally | Safe |
| **Marks sensitive** | Auto-protect | Respected |
| **Shares link** | Revocable access | Control |
| **Gets reported** | Gentle review | Fair |
| **Returns later** | Timeline replay | Nostalgia |

### System rules (golden)

1.  **Default to private**
2.  **Never interrupt exploration**
3.  **Suggest, never demand**
4.  **Reduce visibility, not delete**
5.  **Let trust grow silently**

> **Behavior defines trust.**
