# 2️⃣ STRUCTURE — What exists in the system?

This is your **information architecture + asset model**.

### Core Objects (non-negotiable)

| Object | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **User** | Identity & trust |
| **Map** | Container of meaning |
| **Pin** | Moment / place / knowledge |
| **Route** | Movement & distance |
| **Troupe** | Time & order |
| **Media** | Memory |
| **Permission** | Control |
| **Trust** | Safety |

### Relationships

- **User** → creates many **Maps**
- **Map** → contains **Pins** + **Routes**
- **Route** → auto-generates **Route Pins**
- **Troupe** → organizes **Pins** by day
- **Pin** → owns **Media** + **Rules**

> **Rule:** Nothing exists alone. Everything belongs to a journey.
